## 6. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a secure face authentication system using deep learning, OpenCV, and MySQL. By integrating facial recognition, password hashing, and SQL injection prevention, the system offers enhanced security over traditional authentication methods.

## 7. Future Development & Suggestions
- **Enhancing Model Accuracy**: Train the model on a larger and more diverse dataset.
- **Multi-Device Authentication**: Enable authentication across various devices.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Extend the system to a mobile platform.
- **2-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implement an additional security layer.
- **Live Detection Mechanism**: Add liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks.
